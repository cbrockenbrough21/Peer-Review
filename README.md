# Peer Review Django Project

This repository contains the code for a class project developed as part of **UVA's CS 3240: Software Engineering**. The project is a **Peer Review Web Application** built using Django. The application enables users to collaborate on projects through file uploads, comments, and role-based permissions. It integrates features such as Google login, Amazon S3 for file storage, and PostgreSQL for metadata management, with deployment on Heroku.

- User authentication via Google login.
- File uploads to Amazon S3 with associated metadata.
- Project details, user roles, and comments stored in PostgreSQL.
- Role-based access for administrators, members, and anonymous users.
- Deployment on Heroku for accessibility.
